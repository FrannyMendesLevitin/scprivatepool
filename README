This is my own private SuperCollider code pool.
I also Have a SVN version in Google Code, but GIT seems to be more promising.
The idea is to ublish here the mini apps I make and code I find interesting.
It's just a private pool, so don't expect the best programming skills or masterworks.

All code made by me except where indicated.
