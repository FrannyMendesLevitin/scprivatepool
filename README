This is my own private SuperCollider code pool.
It's just a private pool (mostly for means of synchronization between my machines), so don't expect the best programming skills or masterworks.
It includes:
* startup.rtf file (goes in the SC App Support dir.)
* update.sh (a shell script to update all my SC related stuff, copied from a scrip by cappelnord)
* synths I use frequently (and can be loaded from the menu bar if my startup is used)
* my SC tweets
* classes I'm working on and some usable
* livecoding history (protocoled and unprotocoled sessions if I forget to start the History in the middle of a Jam)
* some projects, applications and tools I made in the past or I'm still working on
* lots of code snippets, tests and examples

All code made by me except where indicated.
